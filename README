Trim is a unix command line utility for cleaning up white space.

By default it will remove all white space at the beginning and end of lines received from standard input.

Reading from files is coming soon.

It also has some options:
-a	Remove all the white space from your input.
-s	Remove white space only from the start of your lines.
-e	Remove white space only from the end of your lines.
-h	This menu.

Some might say "couldn't you just do this with sed? or cut?", to which I would say - "Probably, but why do that when you can write your very own unix text utility?"

Fact: if you write your own unix text utility, you get invited to more parties.

TODO:
Write some tests
Use files in addition to stdin
